# express-ts-typeorm-starter

This is a project template that I made to make things easier for myself in the future.  The goal is to create something that is easily extensible in the event that a particular project grows in size.

This template features TypeScript, Express, auto reloading, eslint, prettier, TypeORM, and uses JWT for authorization.

I wasn't planning on people using this template, but if it helps you, then by all means, go for it!
